Elaboration

This term is used to describe the transformation of Scala SpinalHDL code
into a HDL language such as Verilog of VHDL.  For the purpose of the
SpinalHDL documentation this is usually the meaning of the term.

Within the hardware enginering industry this term is also often used to
describe parts of a flow for targetting hardware based on a particular
technology (FPGA/ASIC/others).  This may transform an input describption
into an output description so the next layer of the flow may proceed
towards building a hardware implementation.
